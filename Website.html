			<p>The Dallas Cowboys are a professional American football team based in the Dallas Fort Worth metroplex. The Cowboys compete in the National Football League (NFL) as a member club of the league's National Football Conference (NFC) East division. The team is headquartered in Frisco, Texas, and plays its home games at ATT Stadium in Arlington, Texas, which opened for the 2009 season. The stadium took its current name prior to the 2013 season. The team mascot is Rowdy.</p>
    
    <p>The team was first known as the Dallas Steers, then the Dallas Rangers. On March 19, 1960, the organization announced that it would be called the Cowboys to avoid confusion with the American Association Dallas Rangers baseball team. The founding investors of the Dallas Cowboys were Clint Murchison, Jr. (45%), John D. Murchison (45%), along with minority shareholders, Toddie Lee and Bedford Wynne (Director and Secretary) (5%),and William R. Hawn (5%). The new owners subsequently hired Tex Schramm as general manager, Gil Brandt as player personnel director, and Tom Landry as head coach. The current owner, president, and general manager is Jerry Jones. The head coach is currently (2014) Jason Garrett.</p>
